So far...

- `bash new` allows you to build a new project
- the makefile commands are printed out, allowing you to:
  - run pytests
  - build the project locally
  - build and run a dev docker image
  - build and run a dev docker stack
- tests run from vscode

Todo

- auto reload in docker dev
- spark example
- ci-cd
- run any type of application using a script, without having to change docker image

Finally

- write concise readme about data engineering
